FIRST Tech Challenge Team 5998 Challenge 2014-2015
The following files preform their respective functions:
- AutoFloor.c is the current version of autonomous mode, started from the floor, however, we want to start from the ramp whenever possible and should tell this to our alliance partner
- Ramp2Goal is the current version but it will be replaced soon by Ramp2ballz
- EthansQuickTel  is the current version of tele-op mode or tele4WD if you dont like innovation
- .gitignore is the usual git trash
The autonomous modes are going to be rewritten soon (see [this issue](https://github.com/lasarobotics/FTC2015-5998/issues/2))
