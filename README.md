The following files preform their respective functions:
- AutoFloor.c is the current version of autonomous mode, started from the floor, however, we want to start from the ramp whenever possible and should tell this to our alliance partner
- Ramp2ballz is the current version but it will be replaced soon by Ramp3nBallz
- EthansQuickTel  is the current version of tele-op mode or tele4WD if you dont like innovation
- .gitignore is the usual git trash
